This is a website designed for a fictional restaurant. I began development on this project while learning React, with the goal of improving my abilities as a front-end developer. The menu was inspired by cuisine I enjoyed in my household growing up. This is the second iteration of the site, the first version was developed as part of the 'Restauraunt Page' project from The Odin Project's Javascript course, and I saw room for improvement which coincided with my foray into React. The site is complete with a contact form and takeout shopping cart that allows customers to modify and checkout their orders. The alerts are powered by sweetalert2.
